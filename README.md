# Grade-Calculator
This program provides a way for students to store their grades and see what grade they'll need on remaining assignments in order to receive a specified grade overall. Modeled after the Ben Eggleston grade calculator, this model uses a MySQL database to store the grades. Upon start up, it will show a list of all the classes the user is currently taking, even displaying their current grade in the class. Version 1.

For a more updated, robust, and user-friendly grade calculator, see [version 3](https://github.com/CodeCrazy97/GradeCalculatorV3).
